// Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

// A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

// We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.

// We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.


//Plan:
//First, use regular expressions and groups to filter anything that is not a letter or number, convert to lower case
//Second, check, if the result is a string of length n, that the index 1,n-1
//2,n-2... have the same value


function palindrome(str) {
  return str
  .match(/(\w+)/g).join("").toLowerCase() //Step 1
  .replaceAll("_","") //_ doesn't get filtered by \w
