//According to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period  T
// of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:
// 2*pi*sqrt(a^3/mu)
// a is the semi-major axis of the orbit
// mu = GM, gravitational constant * mass of the biggest object.
// Return a new array that transforms the elements' average altitude into their orbital periods (in seconds).
// The array will contain objects in the format {name: 'name', avgAlt: avgAlt}.
// The values should be rounded to the nearest whole number. The body being orbited is Earth.
//The radius of the earth is 6367.4447 kilometers, and the GM value of earth is 398600.4418 km3s-2.


//No need to do physics since the test are made using a model of a small
//object orbiting the earth in a circular orbit.
//just consider that a = earth radius + avgAlt since that's the radius of the circle
//The problem manages all units as well.
